\subsection{Literature Survey}

We initially searched for keywords \textit{3D reconstruction}, \textit{point cloud generation}, \textit{deep learning}, \textit{3D point cloud deep learning survey} and found there was rich literature since around 2016. From 2019 there has been a surge in research activity. One marker being Facebook's release of PyTorch3D, with features related specifically to point cloud and image processing.  
Our survey led to a number of public 3D datasets, tools, models and evaluation metrics discussed next.
